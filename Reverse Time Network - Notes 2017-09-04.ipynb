    "The main fluxSense() idea was to add a trajectory at a sensitive point for the gradient, to avoid gradients going to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems like that idea addresses a problem that isn't really there: although the gradients do go very small, at least with the MGO network they are not small enough to kill the learning, and the Hessian minimization quickly focuses on the right direction and gets us home.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, the problem (getting stuck in training) arises because of the term that penalizes small differences in the two outputs, i.e., the term that wants output decisions to be clear. We'll call this the **beta term**. (In the code, we use beta as a param to quantify how much of this term to add to the total cost function.)  This term is needed because otherwise all outputs could go to the desired mean target, without clear decisions. However, in changing the landscape, it looks like this term also creates some obstacles that prodcue local minima. Specifically, if a final output is to *smoothly* go from decision \"0\" to decision \"1\", it *must* pass through ambiguous decision=0.5; thus the term that penalizes thus ambiguous decisions puts an obstacle to moving along that path, and can create local minima.  FluxSense() does solve a problem, and that is the problem it solves: it specifically places a trajectory at decision=0.5, and therefore drives a non-zero gradient (abolishes the local minimum) even if the original data points tend to stay away from that informative location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we do without the beta term? Not really, not without completely changing the nature of the outputs, which currently are single-trial decisions. If we were propagating the probability of a decision, then maybe having the single-trial output be a target like 0.75 might be fine, instead of what we currently do, which is to want single trial to randomly end at output=1 75% of the time, output=0 the other 25%.\n",
    "\n",
    "But are there simpler strategies than fluxSense()? For example, divide the training into two phases, first  train with beta=0; and then start training again, from the resulting endpoint, but now with beta>0? Not obviously: we tried a simple MGO with beta=0, and it turns out that in certain regimes, trainign fails to even get to target=0.75, never mind whether the decisions are ambiguous.\n",
    "\n",
    "> As detailed in a cell below, the issue appeared to be that at beta=0, when initial mean(hits) < 0.5, we go to a limiting case where final mean(hits)=0.5, probably because the fastest way to improve mean(hits) is to drive everyone into a single fixed point and reach 0.5. When initial mean(hits)>0.5, we always get to the target mean(hits)=0.75\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we need beta>0.  This is nto a big general problem, its a specific problem for us (so can't be trumpeted as I wanted to :). That brings us to the current state, namely, asking whether with beta>0 we can find a clear example where training gets stuck, and where fluxSense() would resolve it.  If the answer is yes, will try to incorporate fluxSense() into bbox_Hessian_minimization().\n"
