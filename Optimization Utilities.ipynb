At each step of the minimization, uses ForwardDiff to compute the gradient $\\bf g$ and the Hessian $H$ at the current set of parameter values ${\\bf p_0}$; and then uses constrained_parabolic_minimization() to find the the parameter values ${\\bf p}$, such that $|{\\bf p} - {\\bf p_0}| <= \\eta$, that would minimize the parabolic approximation to the cost function\n",

If this number is equal to the maximum requested (currently hardcoded as 500 iterations), that means that constrained_parabolic_minimization() returned only because it ran into its maximum iteration limit, not because it was successful, and is therefore a sign of a step that may have been taken in a poor direction.\n",
