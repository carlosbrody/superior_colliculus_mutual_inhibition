In addition, make_dict() is central to the gradient- and hessian-taking functions defined here that operate on keyword-value pairs. The reason is that make_dict() can take a vector (as one of its parameters)and turn it into keyword-value pairs, and we need this transformation to work with the ForwardDiff package, since that package only operates on functions of vectors.\n",

    "# make_dict() and ForwardDiffZeros()\n",
    "\n",
    "The ForwardDiff package takes gradients of functions of vectors. `make_dict()` was originally written as an internal function to keyword_vgh(), essentially for turning keyword-value pairs into a vector that ForwardDiff could work with. The main goal was to make gradient-taking flexible, so the user could easily switch between different chosen parameters. However, make_dict() turns out to be useful externally, for the user, also.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic usage of make_dict is to take a list of strings, and a vector of numeric values of the same length, and turn those into a dictionary that Julia can use when passing paramaters. Thus, for example,\n",
    "\n",
    "> `tester(;a=10, b=20)`\n",
    "\n",
    "is equivalent to\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> `tester(;make_dict([\"a\", \"b\"], [10, 20])...)`\n",
    "\n",
    "which can be used to pass all the various desired parameter values as a single vector, which is what ForwardDiff needs, and is how keyword_vgh() works.\n",
    "\n",
    "> (**An aside on Julia symbols and passing sets of keyword-values to functions**: The `...` is Julia-speak for \"this argument contains a set of multiple keyword-value pairs.\"  In Julia, that can be either a dictionary of Symbol=>value pairs, or a list of (Symbol, value) tuples). \n",
    "\n",
    "> `make_dict()` itself returns a dictionary, so `make_dict([\"a\", \"b\"], [10, 20])` returns `Dict(:a=>10, :b=>20)`.  A Julia Symbol stands for a variable; you can go back and forth between strings and Symbols by using, for example, `Symbol(\"a\")` to get `:a`, or use `string(:a)` to get `\"a\"`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Typical user-level usage of make_dict()\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical thing a user will use make_dict() for is to merge paramater values with a superset of default parameter values. For example, suppose you have defined a scalar function\n",
    "\n",
    "> `function tester(;a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4)`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can decide you want your default parameter values to be as defined here:\n",
    "\n",
    "> `defaults = Dict(:a=>10, :b=20, :c=>30, :d=>40)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that, you can call `tester()` with this set of values by calling `tester(;defaults...)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now suppose you've done a minimization search over two of these paramaters. Let's say that you indicate your choice of those parameters in `args = [\"a\", \"c\"]`. And let's say the resulting values for them are in the two-long vector `pars`.  You want to call `tester()` with the default parameter values _except_ for whatever is indicated in `args` and `pars`. To do that, you use the optional third argument of `make_dict()` as follows:\n",
