    "# 0) The path so far to finding model parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "We wanted to set up something where the Pro vs. Anti signal from PFC biased competition when the light got turned on later. If we initally set up a bistable system (stable points (1,0,0,1) and (0,1,1,0) only, then this is very difficult. Because before the light comes on we're always trying to stop the system from flowing off to one of those stable points. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can try to do this by having different amounts of overall excitation during rule/delay periods versus target periods, since that difference can put us across a bifurcation: low E and we have only one stable point, high E and we have two stable points (as in Machens, Romo, Brody, 2005). But during the delay, we also wanted to have very little competition betweem Right and Left sides, so we don't start with too much of a bias. Maybe such a bias could have been overcome with a strong target light signal, but in any event, that path was not pursued here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, the idea pursued here was to set up a tri-stable system, with stable points at (0,0,0,0), (1,0,0,1) and (0, 1, 1, 0). That way the dynamics of the system themselves prevent runaway excitation during the rule-delay period, and quench R vs L excitation during the same period.\n"

So horizontal weights were set to zero, turning the network into two totally independent two-node networks. Only when tristability was established there were the horizontal weights turned back on.

    "\n",
    "This documents the `cline_follower()` code in the cell below, which finds nullclines for two-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basis of the code is as follows. Let's suppose we want to follow a constant surface for some function $f()$ of two dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f = f(x,y) \\; \\Rightarrow \\\\\n",
    "~ \\\\\n",
    "{\\rm d}f = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}{\\rm d} x + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}{\\rm d} y \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we want $f=\\text{ constant}$, setting ${\\rm d}f = 0$ gives us\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{{\\rm d}x}{{\\rm d}y} = -\\frac{\\partial f / \\partial y}{\\partial f / \\partial x}   \\tag{1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Form a given point $(x,y)$, then, if ${\\rm d}x$ and ${\\rm d}y$ are small and their ratio is given by (1) above, we should have $f(x,y) = f(x+{\\rm d}x, y+ {\\rm d}y)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are additional tricks to the code, because as we follow a nullcline, it can curve and change direction-- that is, as we follow the nullcline it could be that at first x is increasing, but then as we go past a curve in which the nullcline heads back towards smaller x, then x will be decreasing, even while we are still moving forwards along the curve defining the nullcline. When we take steps along the nullcline, we have to take that into account. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do that, note that in (1) above, we could choose to find our next point by making a fixed ${\\rm d}x$ step and figuring out what that implies for what ${\\rm d}y$ should be. Or, we we could have done it the other way around, i.e., we could have made a fixed ${\\rm d}y$ step and then figure out what that implies for ${\\rm d}x$. If the nullcline is mostly horizontal, it makes sense to take the fixed steps in the $x$ direction, and then we'll be fine even if the corresponding step in the $y$ direction is zero. Conversely, if the nullcline is mostly vertical, then it makes sense to take steps in $y$ and then we'll be fine even if the corresponding step in $x$ is zero. Consequently, in the code below, we keep track of whhich axis we're taking the fixed steps along (which \"branch\"). This also helps us keep track of which direction (increasing or decreasing) the fixed step should be in. If we're going in the increasing direction for $x$, we won't change sign to the decreasing direction unless we go through a vertical part of the nullcline, and therefore go through a stretch of taking the fixed step along $y$."

    "# 9) Using nullclines to design a network for unilateral opto\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial intuition is that if opto silenced one side of the brain completely, the other side would be less inhibited. If that put the other side in a regime with a single stable point (because of too little inhibition to kick the competition into gear), then unilateral opto would lead to high activity in the contralateral PRO unit always, and would cause a reliable ipsi bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if opto silenced one side of the brain entirely, the network would then be a two-node network. We can examine that two-node network's nullclines to understand things better, as in Wong and Wang J. Neurosci. 2005.\n",
    "\n",
    "A further idea is to conceptually separate the activity in the 4-node network into two modes: **First**, a \"symmetric\" mode in which the two Anti units are identical to each other, and the two Pro units are identical to each other. In this case we boild down to a 2-node network again, in which each unit inhibits itself (e.g. because the two Anti units are connected through mutual inhibition, if the two Anti units have identical activity, then this is like self-inhibition). **Second**, an \"asymmetric\" mode in which the Pro unit on one side of the brain and the Anti unit on the other side have identical activity. Again this boils down to a 2-node network, but this time each node receives inhibition from the other node equal to the vertical inhibitory weight (from the unit on its own side of the brain), plus the horizontal inhibitory weight (since the unit on the other side of the brain is assumed to have activity equal to that of the vertically-oriented one on the same side).\n",
    "\n",
    "Examining those two modes separately, we're trying to find a regime in which unilateral opto = \"off\" puts the network in a bistable mode, with the usual competition and resolution; but unilateral opto = \"on\" puts the spared side of the brain into a monostable, high activity mode (thus providing the reliable ipsi bias).\n",
    "\n",
    "A constant E during the target period can be found that does that-- strong enough to put the dynamics in the monostable regime for unilateral opto = \"on\", but weak enough that during opto = \"off\" the network is still bistable. Unfortunately, as documented in the next section below, when these parameters are run on the full 4-node network, we don't get the right unit to win even in simple \"pro\" trials (let alone opto)"

    "**Unfortunately,** it doesn't work at all, at least not in the regime explored here. It turns out that if the constant input during the target period is too large (here, 2.3), then the unit that both had the slight advantage during the delay period (because of PFC input) and received the light signal from the target does *not* become a winning unit. For high constant E, the other two units it is connected together have an advantage, and they end up being the ones that win. Contrary to initial intuition.\n",

    "However, it could well be that in the regime that Marino was exploring, in which there is high activity during the delay period, not just a little bias, this approach does work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The other way out** feels a little like cheating, but may not be unreasonable. Let's assume that there's a population of SC neurons that are not Pro or Anti or Ipsi or Contra selective. Let's assume that, overall, they provide across-hemisphere inhibition (and could provide net within-hemisphere inhibition or excitation, we don't know). Then unilateral opto would silence these guys (in addition to perturbing the neurons that are being modeled in the nodes of our 4-node network), and this in turn would result in reduced inhibition, i.e., increased excitation, on the other side of the brain. This increased excitation could be enough to drive the network into the monostable regime-- but would not screw things up for regular non-opto trials, because it kicks in only for unilateral opto. That would make everything work.\n"

    "# 11) Marino's constant-Pro-bias approach within the low delay-period firing rate network\n",
    "\n",
    "In Marino's network (not yet properly reproduced in section (7) above), firing rates during the delay period can be quite high. An important component is that the difference in firing rates between Anti vs Pro units is much bigger in Pro trials than in Anti trials, because of the constant Pro bias. This means that when delay period opto hits, there is an opportunity for the SNR in Anti trials to be hit harder than the SNR of Pro trials, thus leading to a preferential impairment of Anti over Pro trials.\n",
